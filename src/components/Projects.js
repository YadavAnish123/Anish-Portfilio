                        <p> This device which is developed by our team it can detects the freshness of fruits and pesticides in the vegetables using sensor also Artificial Intelligence as well as Machine Learning technique and this two are very cost effective solution for a developing country like India and it also targeted the crops likes Rice , wheat which has the possibilities by the attack of insecticides for that we use Phosphine Sensor. So, developed not only the sensors, camera and microcontroller for the detection of freshness of the fruits and the vegetables. Our future aim to detect the Phosphine level in the crops which is right now the prime concern of Food corporation of India (Ministry of Food).

                        <h2>Overview and Uses</h2>
                        <p>
                            We have developed an innovative solution to monitor the freshness of fruits and vegetables in industrial settings. Our system involves placing a specialized device in close proximity to the produce, which effectively assesses its condition. Specifically, the device employs an MQ4 sensor capable of detecting methane levels. When fruits or vegetables begin to deteriorate, they emit a gas known as methane.
                            <hr />

                            After extensive research, rigorous testing, and on-site validation, we have determined that a threshold value of 255 ppm for methane is indicative of spoilage. To facilitate seamless data transmission, we have integrated an ESP8266 WiFi module, allowing us to relay information to a Firebase server.
                            <hr />

                            To provide users with convenient access to this data, we have created a user-friendly web interface. This interface displays real-time information regarding both methane levels and temperature readings sourced from the Firebase server. In the event that the methane levels surpass the established threshold, the system triggers notifications. Users are promptly alerted through email notifications, an audible buzzer, and a conspicuous red LED indicator. This comprehensive alert system ensures that consumers are promptly informed when a particular fruit or vegetable may not be suitable for consumption.
                            <hr />
                            Our solution represents a significant step forward in reducing food waste and promoting food safety within the industrial sector. Through this innovative technology, we aim to enhance the quality and longevity of produce throughout the supply chain.

                            It provides much flexibility by allowing users to choose the abnormal behaviours they want to be detected and keeps track of every abnormal event to be reviewed. We used three methods to detect abnormal behaviours: Motion influence map, Pattern recognition models, State event model.
